# Manager Notes

## Current Ratchet

The Rifts repository has been initialized with project ground truth for the cooperative asymmetric board game web application.

This repo is currently in discovery and architecture setup. No application code has been scaffolded yet.

## Project Intent

Build a digital-first, web-based prototype of a cooperative asymmetric board game where each player uses a different gameplay engine while interacting with one shared world.

The first prototype should prove:

- four players can use four mechanically different engines
- all engines can interact through a shared universal event contract
- hidden and asymmetric information can be handled safely by the app
- team rounds and intermingled opportunities create meaningful cooperation
- personal advancement can compete with team advancement without encouraging griefing

## Ground Truth Documents

- Product concept: `docs/product/cooperative-asymmetric-board-game-concept.md`
- Stack recommendation: `docs/architecture/web-app-stack.md`
- Stack ADR: `docs/architecture/adr-0001-web-app-stack.md`
- Coding standards: `docs/standards/coding-standards.md`
- Repo operating model: `RATCHETING.md`

## Architectural Direction

Use a TypeScript monorepo with:

- React + Vite for the browser client
- PixiJS for the shared board/map surface
- Colyseus for authoritative multiplayer rooms
- a custom pure TypeScript rules package
- PostgreSQL for persistence
- Drizzle ORM for typed SQL access
- Zod for validation at trust boundaries
- Vitest for rules and content tests
- Playwright for browser and multiplayer flow tests

The central architecture rule is:

```txt
Player engine action -> universal game event -> shared world reducer
```

## Constraints For Future Agents

- Read `RATCHETING.md` first.
- Work on `develop` for active changes.
- Keep project-specific decisions in this repo.
- Do not put game rules inside React components or Colyseus room classes.
- Do not send full hidden game state to clients.
- Keep the first prototype small and focused on one playable mission.
- Avoid hardcoding Rifts IP into generic engine logic.

## Recommended Next Click

Create the initial monorepo scaffold and implement the pure rules package skeleton:

- workspace package setup
- strict TypeScript config
- lint/format/test scripts
- base shared ID types
- universal event types
- initial game state shape
- first reducer tests

This should happen before building the PixiJS board or Colyseus room.

## In Flight

- No implementation code exists yet.
- No deployment config exists yet.
- No database schema exists yet.
- No CI workflow exists yet.
